<p class="ShortParagraph">V-Rising is a game where you take on the role of a vampire and progress through a pre-generated world collecting resources, building castles, fighting bosses, and potential battling against other players. 
   <br>
   The game has fun and rare mechanics which you do not see often in many games; these mechanics range from having to hide in the shadows (or waiting for night time) to traverse the world and reach various milestones.</p>
